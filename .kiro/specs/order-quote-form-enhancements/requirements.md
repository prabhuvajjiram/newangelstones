# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the order quote form with dynamic color selection, improved validation, and mobile responsiveness. The enhancements will improve user experience by providing a comprehensive color selection from available granite colors, better price validation with user-friendly warnings, and ensuring the form works seamlessly on mobile devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to select from all available granite colors dynamically loaded from the system, so that I can see all current color options without manual updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form loads THEN the system SHALL populate the color dropdown with all granite colors from the images/colors directory
2. WHEN a new color image is added to the colors folder THEN the system SHALL automatically include it in the dropdown options
3. WHEN the user selects a color THEN the system SHALL display the color name clearly
4. WHEN the user needs a color not in the list THEN the system SHALL provide an "Other" option with a text input field
5. IF the user selects "Other" THEN the system SHALL show a text input field for custom color specification
6. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL require a color selection (either from dropdown or custom text)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive helpful feedback about pricing, so that I can understand when prices might need review while still being able to submit my quote request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a price of $0 THEN the system SHALL display a soft warning message
2. WHEN the price warning is shown THEN the system SHALL still allow form submission
3. WHEN the price is greater than $0 THEN the system SHALL not display any price warning
4. WHEN the price field is empty THEN the system SHALL require price entry before submission
5. WHEN the price is negative THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission with an error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the order quote form to work seamlessly on my phone or tablet, so that I can easily submit quotes from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form is accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display all elements in a mobile-friendly layout
2. WHEN form fields are tapped on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate input methods (numeric keypad for prices, etc.)
3. WHEN the form is viewed on small screens THEN the system SHALL stack form elements vertically for better readability
4. WHEN tables are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL make them horizontally scrollable or stack columns
5. WHEN buttons are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure they are large enough for touch interaction
6. WHEN the form is submitted on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and prevent double submissions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the color selection to be maintainable without code changes, so that new colors can be added by simply uploading image files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new color image is added to images/colors directory THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and include it
2. WHEN color images are removed from the directory THEN the system SHALL automatically remove them from options
3. WHEN color image filenames are changed THEN the system SHALL reflect the new names in the dropdown
4. WHEN the system reads color files THEN the system SHALL handle various image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, webp)
5. WHEN color names are generated from filenames THEN the system SHALL format them properly (remove extensions, handle spaces and capitalization)
