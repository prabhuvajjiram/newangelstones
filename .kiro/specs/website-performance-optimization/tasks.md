## Technical Implementation Notes

### PHP 8.3 Specific Optimizations
- Use PHP 8.3's improved performance features (JIT compilation, better opcache)
- Leverage new PHP 8.3 functions for better string and array handling
- Implement proper error handling with PHP 8.3's enhanced exception handling

### Apache/cPanel Constraints
- All optimizations must work within shared hosting limitations
- Use .htaccess for server-level optimizations (caching, compression, redirects)
- Implement file-based caching instead of database caching to avoid resource limits
- Use PHP's built-in functions instead of external libraries

### No External Dependencies
- All JavaScript will be vanilla ES6+ (no jQuery dependencies for new code)
- CSS optimizations using pure CSS and PHP processing
- Image processing using PHP GD extension (standard in most hosting)
- Performance monitoring using browser APIs and PHP file logging

### Cost-Free Solutions
- Local file-based performance metrics storage
- Browser-based performance monitoring (no external services)
- Self-hosted analytics and monitoring dashboard
- Use existing server resources efficiently without additional costs
